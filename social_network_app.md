## Social network application

**Used technologies:**
- Flutter;
- provider;
- Firebase (Auth, CloudFunctions, FireStore, Storage);
- Rest API;
- Facebook\Google auth.

**Platform:** iOS, Android.

Developed a feature-rich social network application that incorporated achievements, levels, and follower systems to enhance user engagement. The application supported Google and Facebook authentication for seamless user onboarding. Upon registration, a backend Cloud Function automatically created user accounts on an external website using REST APIs.

**Key features included:**

-   **Community and Discussion Functionality**: Enabled users to interact, create discussions, and build a community.
-   **Achievements and Trophies**: Users could earn unique trophies, displayed not only as images but also as interactive 3D models. These models were fully manipulable, allowing users to rotate and scale them.

This project showcased strong skills in integrating third-party APIs, using cloud functions, and delivering an engaging user experience through modern UI/UX principles.
